**About Alexandria Coombe**

Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies I have focused on policy research and data analysis. My interests span areas including prison reform, climate change, agriculture, education, and other state and federal social policies. I received my bachelor's degree in political science in 2023, and I will be completing my master's in data analytics and computational social science in December 2024. I am passionate about creating policy for the people that is supported by data rather than opinions.
